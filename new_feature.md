The new feature that I attempted to add was a drawing canvas that turned the user's drawings into ASCII characters. This is a reasonable feature to excpect in a frontend project due to the rather straightforward concept of turning points of a line into text symbols. It was supposed to turn a drawing made by the user on the canvas into an ASCII representation. ChatGPT instead made a drawing canvas that drew with ASCII characters. Even upon several rounds of clairification, Chat failed to understand that I wanted the drawings to be turned into ASCII characters, not the other way around.
